Features:
 - Interrupt handling.

INSTRUCTIONS AND NOTES:

I should have a cross compiler built (along with binutils)
 - There is one at earth. It is under $HOME/bin/cross/
 - To use it for the session I have to do `export PATH="$HOME/bin/cross/bin:$PATH"`


TODO:
 - I have to implement memcpy, strlen, strcmp, etc and put them in common.c and common.h
 - Apart from those I should also implement monitor_write_hex(u32int) and monitor_write_dec(u32int)
